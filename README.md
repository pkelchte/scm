scm
===

An extended version of scm.go: http://pkelchte.wordpress.com/2013/12/31/scm-go/, A minimal Lisp (Scheme) interpreter in Go.

It is inspired by Abelson and Sussman's [Scheme evaluator](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node77.html) in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, and Peter Norvig's [lis.py interpreter](http://norvig.com/lispy.html).
